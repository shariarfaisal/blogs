# Step 1: List available timezones


```
timedatectl list-timezones


```


- Press Space to scroll to the next page, b to scroll back a page.
- Once you find the timezone you want to use, press q to go back to the command line.

# Step 2: Set the desired timezone


Be sure to replace desired_timezone with the timezone you selected from the list:


```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone desired_timezone


```


For example, to set the timezone to New York use this command:


```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York


```


# Step 3: Verify that the timezone has been set properly


```
timedatectl


```


```
Example output:      Local time: Fri 2016-03-25 12:00:43 EDT
  Universal time: Fri 2016-03-25 16:00:43 UTC
        Timezone: America/New_York (EDT, -0400)
. . .

```


# Step 4: Install NTP


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ntp


```


Once the NTP package installation is completed, your server will have NTP synchronization enabled!
