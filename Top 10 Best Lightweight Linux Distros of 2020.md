# Top 10 Best Lightweight Linux Distros of 2020

```UNIX/Linux```

Today, we’re talking about the best lightweight Linux distros of 2020 today. If you want to bring an old computer back to life or you are a minimalist who likes their computer systems lean, this article is for you.


People choose Linux for three main reasons:


1. More control/freedom
2. Snappy performance
3. Less resource usage

And the low-resource usage part is what we’re focusing on today.


In a previous article, we talked about some of the best Linux distros overall. So if resource usage is not a concern for you, feel free to look through that article!


Today, I’ve chosen for you the 10 best Linux distributions that offer superb stability, easy to use interfaces, and some even offering an out-of-the-box beautiful look. All of this while being extremely lightweight!


# Why lightweight Linux distros matter in 2020?


Linux users love the simplicity that Linux brings along with it. That’s one of the major reasons why most Linux-“fans” don’t go for other operating systems that restrict control.


So even if you are on a powerful computer system, using a lightweight Linux distribution gives you the empty space to fill in with what matters.


Compared to a lot of other operating systems that take up 40-60% of the system resources, you are left with a lot more resources of your system to work on tasks that are important to you.


# What makes a Linux distribution Lightweight?


As beginner Linux users turn into power users with continued usage, they tend to understand that most of the utilities offered by the beginner-friendly distributions are unnecessary for daily use.


That’s when distributions focused at power users allow them with the flexibility to pick and install what they need.


The ability to have only what you need in the system with no unnecessary resource usage, is what makes a system lightweight.


In a typical lightweight Linux system, you can expect the memory, the disk space, and the CPU time is used only for what’s truly necessary to you. Not what’s pre-added.


Apart from that, the distros that do come pre-built, are built with lightweight desktop environments like XFCE, LXDE, Openbox, and the likes.
