## About Wordpress


Wordpress is a free and open source website and blogging tool that uses php and MySQL. It was created in 2003 and has since then expanded to manage 22% of all the new websites created and has over 20,000 plugins to customize its functionality.


# Step One—Prerequisites!


This tutorial covers installing Wordpress. Before you go through it, make sure your server is ready for Wordpress. 
You need root privileges (check out steps 3 and 4 for details):
 Initial Server Setup


You need to have nginx, MySQL, and PHP-FPM installed on your server: 
LEMP tutorial


Only once you have the user and required software should you proceed to install wordpress! 


# Step Two—Download WordPress


We can download Wordpress straight from their website:


```
wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```


This command will download the zipped wordpress package straight to your user's home directory. You can unzip it the the next line:


```
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz 
```


# Step Three—Create the WordPress Database and User


After we unzip the wordpress files, they will be in a directory called wordpress in the home directory on the virtual private server.


Now we need to switch gears for a moment and create a new MySQL directory for wordpress.


Go ahead and log into the MySQL Shell:


```
mysql -u root -p
```


Login using your MySQL root password, and then we need to create a wordpress database, a user in that database, and give that user a new password. Keep in mind that all MySQL commands must end with semi-colon.


First, let's make the database (I'm calling mine wordpress for simplicity's sake; feel free to give it whatever name you choose):


```
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```


Then we need to create the new user. You can replace the database, name, and password, with whatever you prefer:


```
CREATE USER wordpressuser@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```


Set the password for your new user:


```
SET PASSWORD FOR wordpressuser@localhost= PASSWORD("password");
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```


Finish up by granting all privileges to the new user. Without this command, the wordpress installer will not be able to start up:


```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```


Then refresh MySQL:


```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```


Exit out of the MySQL shell:


```
exit
```


# Step Four—Setup the WordPress Configuration


The first step to is to copy the sample WordPress configuration file, located in the WordPress directory, into a new file which we will edit, creating a new usable WordPress config:


```
cp ~/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php ~/wordpress/wp-config.php
```


Then open the wordpress config:


```
sudo nano ~/wordpress/wp-config.php
```


Find the section that contains the field below and substitute in the correct name for your database, username, and password:


```
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'wordpressuser');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
```


Save and Exit.


# Step Five—Copy the Files


We are almost done uploading Wordpress to the server. 
We need to create the directory where we will keep the wordpress files:


```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www
```


Transfer the unzipped WordPress files to the website's root directory.


```
sudo cp -r ~/wordpress/* /var/www
```


We can modify the permissions of /var/www to allow future automatic updating of Wordpress plugins and file editing with SFTP. If these steps aren't taken, you may get a "To perform the requested action, connection information is required" error message when attempting either task.


First, switch in to the web directory:


```
cd /var/www/
```


Give ownership of the directory to the nginx user, replacing the "username" with the name of your server user.


```
sudo chown www-data:www-data * -R 
sudo usermod -a -G www-data username
```


# Step Six—Set Up Nginx Server Blocks


Now we need to set up the WordPress virtual host.


Create a new file for the for WordPress host, copying the format from the default configuration:


```
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
```


Open the WordPress virtual host:


```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
```


The configuration should include the changes below (the details of the changes are under the config information):


```
server {
        listen   80;


        root /var/www;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;

        server_name 192.34.59.214;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;
        }

        error_page 404 /404.html;

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
              root /usr/share/nginx/www;
        }

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
        location ~ \.php$ {
                try_files $uri =404;
                #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
                # With php5-fpm:
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
                fastcgi_index index.php;
                include fastcgi_params;
                 }
        

}
```


Here are the details of the changes:


- Change the root to /var/www/
- Add index.php to the index line. 
- Change the server_name from local host to your domain name or IP address (replace the example.com in the configuration) 
- Change the "try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;" line to "try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;" to enable Wordpress Permalinks with nginx
- Uncomment the correct lines in “location ~ \.php$ {“ section

Save and Exit that file.


# Step Seven—Activate the Server Block


Although all the configuration for worpress has been completed, we still need to activate the server block by creating a symbolic link:


```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/wordpress
```


Additionally, delete the default nginx server block.


```
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```


Install php5-mysql:


```
sudo apt-get install php5-mysql
```


Then, as always, restart nginx and php-fpm:


```
sudo service nginx restart
```


```
sudo service php5-fpm restart
```


# Step Eight—RESULTS: Access the WordPress Installation


Once that is all done, the wordpress online installation page is up and waiting for you:


Access the page by visiting your site's domain or IP address (eg. example.com/wp-admin/install.php) and fill out the short online form (it should look like this).
