# Introduction to the eBook


Node.js is a popular open-source runtime environment that can execute JavaScript outside of the browser. The Node runtime is commonly used for back-end web development, leveraging its asynchronous capabilities to create networking applications and web servers. Node is also a popular choice for building command line tools.


In this book, you will go through exercises to learn the basics of how to code in Node.js, gaining skills that apply equally to back-end and full stack development in the process.


By the end of this book you will be able to write programs that leverage Node’s asynchronous code execution capabilities, complete with event emitters and listeners that will respond to user actions. Along the way you will learn how to debug Node applications using the built-in debugging utilities, as well as the Chrome browser’s DevTools utilities. You will also learn how to write automated tests for your programs to ensure that any features that you add or change function as you expect.
