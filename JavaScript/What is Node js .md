# What is Node js 

```JavaScript``` ```Node.js``` ```Glossary```

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows programmers to create fast, scaleable, back-end JavaScript applications. The asynchronous and event-driven nature of Node.js makes it well suited for creating applications that can handle many connections at once, a common task for web servers and other back-end applications.


By leveraging JavaScript on both the frontend and the backend, development can be more consistent and full-stack web applications can be designed within the same development environment.
