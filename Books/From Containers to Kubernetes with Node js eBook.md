# Introduction to the eBook


This book is designed to introduce you to using containers and Kubernetes for full-stack development. You’ll learn how to develop a full-stack application using Node.js and MongoDB and how to manage them — first with Docker, then with Docker Compose, and finally with Kubernetes.


This book is based on the From Containers to Kubernetes with Node.js tutorial series found on DigitalOcean Community. The topics that it covers include how to:


1. 
Build a Node.js application using Docker for development

2. 
Integrate a NoSQL database into your Node.js application using MongoDB

3. 
Manage your development environment with Docker Compose

4. 
Migrate your Docker Compose workflow to Kubernetes

5. 
Scale your Node.js and MongoDB application using Helm and Kubernetes

6. 
Secure your containerized Node.js application using Nginx, Let’s Encrypt, and Docker Compose


Each chapter is is designed to build progressively from the first. However, if you’re familiar with a topic, or are more interested in a particular section, feel free to jump to the chapter that best suits your purpose.
